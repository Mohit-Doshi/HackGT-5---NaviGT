# HackGT-5---NaviGT

I was a part of a team of three Computer Science students at HackGT 5: Dare to Venture, held at the Georgia Institute of Technology from October 19-21, 2018. 

The team worked towards a project that would address acessibility issues for the differently abled. We ended up creating NaviGT - a revolutionary tool designed to optimize how people interact with buildings around them. It allows institutions to store user data safely on a portal and authenticate those users in turn. The motive of doing this is aimed at engaging the disabled by optimizing building architecture to their benefit. Examples include scheduling elevators, directing volunters for assistance, reserving a seat in a classroom, and more. 

The service in its current version uses a smartphone to communicate with an ID card via NFC (Near-Field Communication) and gather user data. This data is analyzed and the user can add locations and corresponding activities associated with that location. A system stores this data, and anytime a user scans in, this prior data is accessed and loaded. We utilized Google's Cloud Platform for creating web APIs to the database. Azure's services were used for database hosting. We also used a Qualcomm Snapdragon to display the backend (web API calls) as well using Python. The team programmed an Android Application using Android Studio. This application uses a phone's NFC capabilities to read an NFC tag and display an "action" or a "service" for the user via a Web API call.

The team won the "Best IoT Hack using a Qualcomm device" award. https://devpost.com/software/navigt

The team consisted of myself, Colin Sergi, and Praveen Balaji.

Myself and Praveen programmed the Android Application using Android Studio.

Colin Sergi @csergi programmed the entire backend component of the project as well as hosting the web service on Google Cloud Platform. https://github.com/csergi/HackGT2018

Colin and Praveen also programmed the Snapdragon using Python.
